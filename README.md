## Why I'm here
When I was a wee lad I couldn't stay away from something creative even if someone payed me. My hand were always molding something: Fimo, knitting, carving wood, cosplaying, acrylic painting, digital drawing, sawing, writing and much more. But nothing really... stuch. They all came and went, maybe resurfecing from time to time.
At the time I was thinking about the future, what I wanted to be and what I wanted to do. 
My parents pushed for something like "chemist", because I liked scientific subjects, but it was just a little flirt, nothing serius.
Then my little brother broke a tooth: the tablet he was watching videos on, fell on his face. I was in the same room and I screamed for my parents worried for his live. But nothing happend, not even blood was spilled. So, while my mother was fussing over my brother, I wanted to see who was the culprit of this affront: Who dared hurt my brother?
Flowey... Yea, that talking flower from Undertale, in his final form, was on that tablet.
"What I'm watching? Why is he so strange? Who is he?". I was so absorbed by the thing that I didn't noticed that everithing was back to normal and just me and my brother were left in the room. "You know that a single guy made it?" he told me, with a chipped front tooth. 
"So... Can I do that?"
