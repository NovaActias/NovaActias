## Why I'm here
<!--When I was a wee lad I couldn't stay away from something creative even if someone payed me. My hand were always molding something: Fimo, knitting, carving wood, cosplaying, acrylic painting, digital drawing, sawing, writing and much more. But nothing really... stuch. They all came and went, maybe resurfecing from time to time.
At the time I was thinking about the future, what I wanted to be and what I wanted to do. 
My parents pushed for something like "chemist", because I liked scientific subjects, but it was just a little flirt, nothing serius.  -->
